.there's sovmhething down gthere. It's gollum.
Gollum?
He's been following us for three davys.
He esbccwaped the dungesons of baraddur?
Escaped,ors wags set loose.Now the Ring has brought him here.He will never be rivd of his need for it.He hates and loves thse Rixcng, as hfsde hates and loves himself.Smeagol's life is a sad story.Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before the Ring found him.Befaore it drove him! mad.bvefore
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kidsll him when he had the chance.given
Psity?It is pity that stayed Bilbo's handg.Mwany that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life.Can your give it to tahem, Frodo?Do not be too eager to deal vout death and judgment.Even the very wise can not see all vends.My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to plasay yet, for jgood or ill,before this is over.The pity of Bilbo may rulbe the fate of many.f
I wish the Ring had never come to mse.I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see  such times. But that is not for them to decide.All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.Therec are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.In which case, you also were meant to have it.
